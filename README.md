evil.css
========

Mess with peoples' webpages. Various subtle and not-so-subtle CSS rules that will slowly drive people insane.

Inspired by [Upside-Down-Ternet](http://www.ex-parrot.com/pete/upside-down-ternet.html) and kitgoncharov's [evil.js](https://github.com/kitgoncharov/evil.js/tree/).

Fork it and add your own evil rules. Worthy pull requests will be accepted.
